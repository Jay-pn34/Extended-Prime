# Extended Prime

Extended Prime is a Python project that generates and visualizes prime numbers starting from various initial values. The project includes:

- `Extended Prime gen.py`: Generates prime numbers starting from values between 2 and 99, up to 499, and organizes them into a pandas DataFrame.
- `Extended Prime visualizer.py`: Visualizes the generated prime numbers using a scatter plot.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jay-pn34/Extended-Prime.git
   cd Extended-Prime
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   Ensure you have `pandas` and `matplotlib` installed. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

### Generating Primes

Run the `Extended Prime gen.py` script to generate prime numbers:

```bash
python "Extended Prime gen.py"
```

This script:

- Iterates over start values from 2 to 99.
- For each start value, finds prime numbers up to 499.
- Stores the results in a pandas DataFrame.

### Visualizing Primes

After generating the primes, visualize them using the `Extended Prime visualizer.py` script:

```bash
python "Extended Prime visualizer.py"
```

This script:

- Reads the DataFrame containing the prime numbers.
- Creates a scatter plot with start values on the x-axis and corresponding primes on the y-axis.
- Displays the plot for analysis.

## Example Output

Below is an example scatter plot generated by the visualization script:
